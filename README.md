## 🧑🏻‍💻 Development

This project uses TypeScript for type checking, [Biome][biome] for code formatting
and linting which is configured in [`biome.json`](./biome.json). It's recommended
to get TypeScript set up for your editor and install an editor plugin (like the
[VSCode Biome plugin][vscode-biome]) to get auto-formatting on saving and get a
really great in-editor experience with type checking and auto-complete.
